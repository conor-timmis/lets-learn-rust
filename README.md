# Let's Learn Rust!

This repository is a learning project for Rust, with the goal of creating a web-based manual for other Rust beginners.

## Disclaimer

I am also learning Rust as I build this project and have very little prior experience with the language. This is a learn-as-I-go adventure! Any contributions, corrections, or suggestions are highly welcome.

## Goal

The aim is to create a simple, classic-themed (Windows XP/2000/95 style) web page that serves as an interactive manual for learning Rust. The Rust application itself will eventually be compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) to run in the browser.

Let's learn together!
